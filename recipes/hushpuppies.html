        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Hushpuppies are a classic Southern take on cornmeal dumplings that feature crispy outsides, fluffy insides, and big corn flavor.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
                <li>5 teaspoons minced canned chipotle chile in adobo sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon lime juice</li>
                <li>3/4 cup cornmeal</li>
                <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 scallions, sliced thin</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
                <li>1 quart peanut or vegetable oil</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Whisk mayonnaise, chipotle, and lime juice together in bowl; set aside for serving.</li>
                <li>Whisk cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cayenne together in large bowl. In separate bowl, whisk buttermilk, eggs, scallions, and mustard together until well combined. Stir buttermilk mixture into cornmeal mixture with rubber spatula until just combined. Let batter sit room temperature for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and line with triple layer of paper towels. Add oil to 12-inch cast-iron skillet until it measures about 3/4 inch deep and heat over medium-high heat to 375 degrees.</li>
                <li>Carefully drop one-third of batter, 1 tablespoon at a time, into oil. Fry until deep golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes, flipping hushpuppies halfway through frying. Adjust burner, if necessary, to maintain oil temperature between 350 and 375 degrees. Transfer hushpuppies to prepared rack and keep warm in oven. (Hushpuppies can be kept warm in oven for up to 30 minutes.)</li>
                <li>Return oil to 375 degrees and repeat with remaining batter in 2 batches. Serve with chipotle aioli.</li>
            </ol>
